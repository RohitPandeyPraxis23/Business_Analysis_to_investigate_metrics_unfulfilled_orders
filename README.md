# Business_Analysis_to_investigate_metrics_unfulfilled_orders

We have two data sets: data_orders and data_offers , both being stored in a CSV format. The data_orders data set contains the following
columns:
order_datetime - time of the order
origin_longitude - longitude of the order
origin_latitude - latitude of the order
m_order_eta - time before order arrival
order_gk - order number
order_status_key - status, an enumeration consisting of the following mapping:
4 - cancelled by client,
9 - cancelled by system, i.e., a reject
is_driver_assigned_key - whether a driver has been assigned
cancellation_time_in_seconds - how many seconds passed before cancellation
The data_offers data set is a simple map with 2 columns:
order_gk - order number, associated with the same column from the orders data set
offer_id - ID of an offer

1.Build up distribution of orders according to reasons for failure: cancellations before and after driver assignment, and reasons for order
rejection and find which has the highest number of orders?
2.We seek to examine if there are any trends in order cancellations by the hour in which it is cancelled.
3.We seek to examine cancellation status based on driver assigned status and by the hour in which an order is cancelled.
4.We seek to examine presence of trend if any in the Average ETA for any order.
